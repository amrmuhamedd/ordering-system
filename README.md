# Nest.js Microservices Application with RabbitMQ and Docker

## Description

This project showcases a microservices architecture implemented using Nest.js, with three services: authentication (auth), billing, and orders. The application employs RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication and is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Installation

To set up the application, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the Application

The application can be run using Docker with the following command:

```bash
# Development
$ docker-compose up --build -V
```

Alternatively, you can run each service individually:

```bash
# Development
$ npm run start:dev
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:

- `src/auth`: Contains controllers, services, DTOs, and other related modules for authentication and authorization.
- `src/billing`: Holds controllers, services, DTOs, etc., for the billing service.
- `src/orders`: Contains modules for handling orders, including controllers, services, DTOs, etc.
- `src/main.ts`: The entry point for the application.

## Design Patterns

The application employs a microservices architecture, promoting loose coupling and independent development of services. Each service has its own set of controllers, services, and DTOs for handling specific tasks.

## Logic and Interaction

- **Authentication Service (auth):** Manages user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

- **Billing Service:** Logs order creation events using asynchronous communication with the Orders Service through RabbitMQ.

- **Orders Service:** Allows creating and listing orders. Publishes order creation events to RabbitMQ for the Billing Service.

## Optimization and Validation

- **Validation:** Data validation is performed using Nest.js's built-in validation features and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for input validation and transformation.

- **Optimization:** The application employs caching, indexing, and asynchronous processing using RabbitMQ for enhanced performance and responsiveness.

## Docker and Microservices

Docker is utilized to containerize the microservices, ensuring consistent and isolated environments. The `docker-compose.yml` file defines service configurations and dependencies.

## Communication with RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is employed for asynchronous communication between services. The Orders Service publishes order creation events to a RabbitMQ queue, which the Billing Service consumes, achieving decoupled communication.

This microservices application, built using Nest.js, RabbitMQ, and Docker, demonstrates a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture that promotes efficient communication and independent development of services.
